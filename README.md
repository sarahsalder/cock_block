<h1> CockBlock is a Chrome Extension that deletes unwanted messages from your OkCupid inbox based on message previews.</h1> <br>

<br>
If you're a woman on OkCupid, you're inundated with messages. Most of those messages are low-quality. What if you could filter out the riff-raff? With Cock Block, you can. Just enter words you don't like into the extension's popup window, and you'll never see a message that starts with those words again.
